# TODO

  * check and update documentation.
  * generate HTML documentation from asciidoc txt files.

  * add POST requests to `JSONP.Request`.
  * add PUT and DELETE requests to `JSONP.Request` (emulated with an _method param).

  * refactor Alpha.Serializer to extend `FormElement`'s or even `Element`'s
    prototype with a `serialize` method, or even better a `send` method.

  * `I18n.localize` method.

  * check if Sugar.js wouldn't be a best solution instead of `Array`, `Inflector`,
    etc. AlphaControl would then concentrate on the DOM instead of JavaScript.
