=== JSONP.Request

This class allows cross-domain GET requests whenever the webservice allows
for JSON with Padding requests.

.Example

  var req = new JSONP.Request();
  req.open('http://example.org/path.json', function() {});
  req.send();

It creates the script tag, attaches it to the DOM, handles the callback and
eventually removes the script tag from the DOM.

  - open(url, callback)
  - send()

Handle POST, PUT and DELETE JSONP requests throught a generated FORM.

// === Serializer [WIP]
// 
// Do not use.
// 
// It should be refactored as HTMLFormElement.prototype.serialize() which means
// AlphaCore should be refactored to allow extending the prototype of such
// elements.
